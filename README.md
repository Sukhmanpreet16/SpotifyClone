Title: "Diljit Dosanjh Playlist Tribute: My Mini Project - Spotify Web Page Clone"
1.Introduction:
Embarking on the journey of creating a web page clone can be both thrilling and challenging, especially when it involves paying tribute to a beloved artist like Diljit Dosanjh. In this blog post, I'll guide you through my experience of developing a mini project â€“ a one-web page clone of Spotify dedicated to a curated playlist of Diljit Dosanjh's hits. From design considerations to technical implementation, let's dive into the details of this musical homage.
2.Choosing the Artist and Playlist:
The first step in this project was to select an artist and curate a playlist that captures the essence of Diljit Dosanjh's musical prowess. With his soulful Punjabi tunes and captivating voice, Dosanjh's hits were a perfect choice. I decided to focus on creating a web page that emulates the Spotify interface, showcasing a handpicked playlist of his popular tracks.
3.Design Inspiration:
The visual appeal of a web page is crucial, especially for music streaming platforms like Spotify. I drew inspiration from Spotify's clean and user-friendly interface, emphasizing simplicity and ease of navigation. Using a cohesive color scheme that complemented Diljit Dosanjh's vibe, I aimed to create a visually engaging experience for users.
4.Building the User Interface:
To replicate Spotify's user interface, I utilized HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Attention to detail was given to the layout, ensuring it mirrored the familiar look and feel of the Spotify app. Incorporating features like album cover display, track listing, and playback controls added authenticity to the playlist clone.
5. Playback Functionality:
Implementing playback functionality was a highlight of this project. Using JavaScript, I created a user-friendly audio player with play, pause, and skip controls. Integrating this feature allowed users to enjoy snippets of Diljit Dosanjh's tracks directly on the web page, enhancing the overall immersive experience.
6.Responsive Design: I employed responsive design techniques to optimize the web page for various screen sizes.
